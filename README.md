As a veteran C#/.Net Developer that has spent the majority of their career working in .Net Framework 4.X, with a mix of Desktop and Asp.Net MVC, I am actively working on updating my skillset into the most recent .Net versions (core, .Net 5+) and the ecosystems.

What I post here is for my own educational purposes but if you happen to find something useful, that's fantastic!  Feel free to use it, but I offer no guarantees nor warantees on the contents herein.
